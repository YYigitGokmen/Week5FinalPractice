Patika+ Fullstack Bootcamp Week5FinalPractice

Program flow:

1- Let's ask the user on the console screen whether he wants to produce a car. If he wants to produce, let him answer with the letter e, if not, let him answer with the letter h. Let's eliminate case sensitivity. If he gives an invalid answer, let's ask the same question again, saying that this answer is invalid.

2- If the user's answer is no, let's end the program. If yes, let's create a car object and let the user enter its properties on the console screen.

3- The Production Date value will be automatically assigned to that moment when the car is produced.

4- If a non-numeric value is tried to be assigned for the Number of Doors, let's prevent the program from throwing an exception, give a warning message and redirect the user to that line. (Research the goto command.)

5- Assign the created car object to a list named cars.

6- Ask the user if he wants to create another car. If yes, go back to the 2nd stage of the program flow and create a new car and add it to the list. If the answer is no, print the Serial numbers and brands of all elements of the cars list.
